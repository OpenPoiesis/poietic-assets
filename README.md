# Poietic Assets

This repository contains resources for the [OpenPoiesis](https://github.com/openpoiesis/)
project.

Contents:

- `Pictograms`: Sources for diagram pictograms, various styles.
- `Icons`: Sources for icons used in the [Playground application](https://github.com/openpoiesis/poietic-playground)


## Pictograms

Pictograms are stored as [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/)
files (see Note on Openness below).

To extract pictograms:

1. Export images as SVG from the Affinity Designer image file
2. Use `pictogram` tool from [Poietic Diagram](https://github.com/OpenPoiesis/poietic-diagram)
   package to extract pictogram data from the SVG files.
3. Use `pictogram` tool to create pictogram catalog.


## Note on Openness from the Author

Despite this project being open-source and the intention is to promote free software,
I struggled with using open-source desktop vector graphic editors, such as Inkscape on
MacOS. Until I find a comfortable, local-first, stable tool that streamlines design
workflow and is fully open, I will keep using proprietary software that fits my needs.
